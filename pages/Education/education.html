<h2>High School</h2>
<p class="text-block">
    It was during high school that I first began to learn to program. Based primarily on one of the first free online
    course from Stanford, I learned the basics of Javascript and then moved on my own to learn Objective-C well enough to
    code a simple spelling quizzer for myself and others in the family.

    I would list grades, but I was homeschooled and didn't directly get those. While it's obviously impossible to quantify
    I did get accepted to Kent State when I was 16 and the equivalent of 10th grade.
