            This is my current project and as such it is a work in progress. I'm trying to make a smart Thermostat
            with my Raspberry PI. At the moment, I have a mostly working
            <a href="https://github.com/IAPark/PITherm-frontend">frontend</a> written in
            <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular 2</a> and a in theory working
            <a href="https://github.com/IAPark/PITherm/">backend</a> written in
            <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The next step is to turn it into a system that we'd actually want to use to control the AC. In
            particular a better interface to set temperature and a live updating feed of the current temperature
            is a must. On the backend, I need to finish the hardware and try to fudge the temperature sensor to
            get slightly more accurate readings, but most importantly I want to implement decent security.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the most annoying things about this project was my decision to use Angular 2 for the frontend.
            It's a really nice framework and I love learning new things, but it's still in alpha and is not intended
            for production projects. Given this was a learning exercise I didn't think this would be too much of a
            problem,
            but because it's so new there isn't any documentation for it yet and some of the documentation that
            does exists is out of date. The good news is because of these factors it has a lot of issues that I
            can actually fix.

            This is a project that will probably pick up again as we get closer to the event on October 11th. The
            App serves as an interface for a backend written by one of our leaders
            <a href="http://pauldilyard.com/">Paul Dilyard</a>. The system supports events and live messages and may
            eventually support a voting system for a prize.

            This was my first Android app so most of the initial time was spent trying to understand Android's API,
            but with that issue eventually mostly solved, the next issue was communication. The eventually plan is
            to
            have four developers each working on a platform (Android, IOS, Windows, and the web) I'm the closest to
            done,
            but trying to work out what my project should do exactly as compared to the other three has been an
            issue.
            During the school year we had semi-regular meetings that helped a lot.
        </p>

        <p>
            The biggest missing feature is push notifications. The backend uses socket.io which my app listens to,
            but
            proper push notification has not yet been implemented.

            When I was in High School, I discovered programming and Minecraft in that order. It was perhaps natural
            then that one of the first projects I would undertake was Minecraft related. This is probably the
            hardest
            of my projects to explain, but in essence this plugin was designed for and is used exclusively on
            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civcraft/">Civraft</a> a server based on building up tools for players
            so that while there are almost no rules things can still be protected and players can in a way punish
            other
            players. Think <a href="https://www.eveonline.com/">Eve Online</a> for Minecraft. When I designed
            Bastion,
            there was <a href="https://github.com/civcraft/citadel">Citadel</a>, a plugin designed to protect blocks
            by allowing the user to "reinforce" them with various resource to make them take multiple breaks to
            actually
            break. This is useful for protecting homes and other builds from people wanting to destroy them, but it
            leaves a pretty big problem, which is there is nothing stopping blocks being placed. Bastion Aims to fix
            that.

            The big challenge for me was dealing with such a large code base for the first time. I did eventually
            make
            my way through with lots of mistakes along the way. Now that I know so much more I'd like to go back at
            some
            point and rewrite some things a got wrong the first time. If nothing else I'd love to go back and add
            unit
            tests. At the time I couldn't work out how to do it, but now with knowledge of the concept of Inversion
            of
            Control I think I could do a much better job, but I'm trying to really devote my time to bettering
            myself
            as a developer and give Java is a bit of a deadend and I'm not playing on the server any more it's taken
            a back seat.

            There are so many other smaller projects I've made from the small programs that taught me to program to
            class
            projects and small experiments. I'll link to just a few examples that I have built by myself and with
            others.

        <p>
            This is the primary way I've learned to program and new technologies and languages. By making projects.
            some inside school but many out I've learned more about programming than I ever have in the classroom.
