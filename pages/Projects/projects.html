            This is my current project and thus is a work in progress. I'm trying to make a smart thermostat
            with my Raspberry PI. At the moment, I have a mostly working
            <a href="https://github.com/IAPark/PITherm-frontend">frontend</a> written in
            <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular 2</a> and a working
            <a href="https://github.com/IAPark/PITherm/">backend</a> written in
            <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> that remains to be tested by real use.
        </p>

        <p>
            The next step is to turn it into a system that we'd actually want to use to control the AC, in
            particular a better interface to set temperature and a live updating feed of the current temperature
            is a must. On the backend, I need to finish the hardware and try to use approximations with the temperature
            sensor to get slightly more accurate readings. Most importantly, I want to implement better security.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the most annoying things about this project was my decision to use Angular 2 for the frontend.
            It's a nice framework and I love learning new things, but it's still in alpha and is not intended
            for production projects. Given this was a learning exercise, I didn't think this would be too much of a
            problem, but because it's so new there isn't good documentation for it yet and some of the documentation
            that does exists is out of date. On the positive side, because of these factors it has a lot of issues
            that I can actually fix and I'm <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/3793">finally</a>
            contributing to an open source project.

            This is a project that will probably pick up again as I get closer to the event on October 11th. The
            app serves as an interface for a backend written by one of our leaders
            <a href="http://pauldilyard.com/">Paul Dilyard</a>. The system supports events and live messages and may
            eventually support a voting system for a prize.

            This was my first Android app so most of my initial time was spent trying to understand Android's API,
            but with that issue eventually mostly solved, the next issue was communication. The eventual plan is
            to have four developers, each working on a platform (Android, IOS, Windows, and the web).  I'm the
            closest to done, but trying to work out what my project should do as compared to the other three
            has led to communication challenges. Semi-regular meetings during the school year helped a lot.
        </p>

        <p>
            The biggest missing feature is push notifications. The backend uses Socket.IO which my app listens to,
            but proper push notification has not yet been implemented.

            When I was in high school, I discovered programming and Minecraft in that order. It was perhaps natural
            then that one of the first projects I would undertake was Minecraft related. This is probably the
            hardest of my projects to explain, but in essence this plugin was designed for and is used exclusively on
            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civcraft/">Civcraft</a>, a server based on building up tools for players
            so that while there are almost no rules things can still be protected and players can in a way punish
            other players. Think <a href="https://www.eveonline.com/">Eve Online</a> for Minecraft. When I designed
            Bastion, there was <a href="https://github.com/civcraft/citadel">Citadel</a>, a plugin designed to protect
            blocks by allowing the user to "reinforce" them with various resources to make them take multiple break
            to actually break. This is useful for protecting homes and other builds from people wanting to destroy
            them, but it leaves a pretty big problem, namely that there is nothing stopping blocks from being placed.
            Bastion aims to fix that.

            The big challenge for me was dealing with such a large code base for the first time. I did eventually
            make my way through with lots of mistakes along the way. Now that I know so much more I'd like to go back at
            some point and rewrite some things I got wrong the first time. If nothing else, I'd love to go back and add
            unit tests. At the time I couldn't work out how to do it, but now with knowledge of the concept of Inversion
            of Control I think I could do a much better job, but I'm trying to really devote my time to bettering
            myself as a developer and given Java is a bit of a deadend and I'm not playing on the server anymore it's
            taken a backseat.

            Many other smaller projects have helped me become a better programmer. While I started these projects for
            diverse reasons: some for class and many more outside of it. I can easily say that it is these projects more
            than any time spent in a class room that has taught me to program. I'll link to just a few examples of these
            and it should be noted that many of these projects do not exist on GitHub or even on my current hard drive.
