                This is my current project and as such it is a work in progress. I'm trying to make a smart Thermostat
                with my Raspberry PI. At the moment, I have a mostly working
                <a href="https://github.com/IAPark/PITherm-frontend">frontend</a> written in
                <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular 2</a> and a in theory working
                <a href="https://github.com/IAPark/PITherm/">backend</a> written in
                <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The next step is to turn it into a system that we'd actually want to use to control the AC. In
                particular a better interface to set temperature and a live updating feed of the current temperature
                is a must. On the backend, I need to finish the hardware and try to fudge the temperature sensor to
                get slightly more accurate readings, but most importantly I want to implement decent security.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the most annoying things about this project was my decision to use Angular 2 for the frontend.
                It's a really nice framework and I love learning new things, but it's still in alpha and is not intended
                for production projects. Given this was a learning exercise I didn't think this would be too much of a
                problem,
                but because it's so new there isn't any documentation for it yet and some of the documentation that
                does exists is out of date. The good news is because of these factors it has a lot of issues that I
                can actually fix.

                This is a project that will probably pick up again as we get closer to the event on October 11th. The
                App serves as an interface for a backend written by one of our leaders
                <a href="http://pauldilyard.com/">Paul Dilyard</a>. The system supports events and live messages and may
                eventually support a voting system for a prize.

                This was my first Android app so most of the initial time was spent trying to understand Android's API,
                but with that issue eventually mostly solved, the next issue was communication. The eventually plan is
                to
                have four developers each working on a platform (Android, IOS, Windows, and the web) I'm the closest to
                done,
                but trying to work out what my project should do exactly as compared to the other three has been an
                issue.
                During the school year we had simi-regular meetings that helped a lot.

            <p>
                The biggest missing feature is push notifications. The backend uses socket.io which my app listens to,
                but
                proper push notification has not yet been implemented.
