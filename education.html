    <h2>High School</h2>
    <p class="text-block">
        It was during high school that I first began to learn to program. Based first on one of the first open course
        wares series of videos from Stanford, I learned the basics of Javascript and then moved on my own to learn
        Objective-C well enough to code a simple spelling quizzer for myself and others in the family.

    <p class="text-block">
        I would list grades, but I was home schooled and didn't directly get those. I'll only say that looking back I
        feel like I did not apply myself to my best ability, but I did get accepted to Kent State when I was 16 and so
        far am doing well there
